## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I restore my Pro purchase?**
A: On the Profile screen, you can tap the "Upgrade to Pro" button which will open a modal. Inside this modal, there is a "Restore Purchases" button that will restore your previous one-time purchase.

**Q: Is the financial data real-time?**
A: The app uses the Black-Scholes model to calculate option prices based on the inputs you provide. It does not use real-time market data feeds.

Thank you for your support!
